# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose is to evaluate machine learning models for predicting credit card risk. Credit risk is an unbalanced classification problem because the good loans outnumber the risky loans. Using a dataset from LendingClub, we evaluate the loan data with the following algorithms: RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids and SMOTEENN algorthms. Additionally, we'll compare two machine learning models to see how they predict risk: BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier. These models will be evaluated on their performance predicting credit risk.

## Results
